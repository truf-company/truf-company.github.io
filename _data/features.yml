      Starting with a regular savings plan early in life is important because time dramatically
      enhances capital accumulation as the magic of compounding accelerates. What this means is that
      delaying your investment start by one year, for example, can delay your reaching financial
      independence by a number of years.

      Most good investment services are tailored for the wealthy. That means there is nothing much you
      can do unless you have a lot of money to start with, and even then the fee structure and level
      will work against small investors.

      For example, one Apple share costs about 150 euros, which is out of reach if one, for example,
      only has 10 euros of extra money at hand. With us you can start investing even with 10 euros or
      less by buying fractions of shares.

      We all know the old proverb “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. All available data about how
      markets have behaved so far indicates that your safest bet in the long-term is to invest in a
      large number of companies.
      <div class="collapse-count">
      <div><h2>9 500+</h2><p>Shares available</p></div>
      <div><h2>10+</h2><p>Stock exchanges</p></div>
      </div>
      In addition, you may invest in various stock indexes, and our strong recommendation is to go to
      the maximum with diversification, i.e. invest in a global index fund.

      We all know that stock markets can go both up and down. However, in the long term the stock
      markets have always gone up and beaten bank interest, bonds and inflation whereas active traders
      have a much bigger probability of failing.

      Some actually say that the smartest investors are the dead ones, because they don’t let emotions
      take the better of them and thus they stay on course to reap the end-of-the-day benefits. That’s
      also why we believe passive long-term investing in a diversified world stock market index fund
      brings the best results over time.
