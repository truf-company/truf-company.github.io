            <h2>What is <span>financial education?</span></h2>
            <p>
              Financial education is a crucial component of personal finance that can
              <span> help people make informed decisions about their money. </span>
              It involves the process of learning about various financial topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and retirement planning. With the lack of financial literacy in society, it is becoming increasingly important for individuals to understand how to manage their finances effectively. The significance of financial education is highlighted by the low savings rate in many countries around the world. Without proper knowledge and understanding of personal finances, people may not be able to take advantage of opportunities to save money or invest their money wisely. Financial education can help individuals make sound decisions when it comes to managing their finances and provide
              them with the tools they need to build wealth over time.

            <p>
              Financial literacy is a significant problem in today's society, with many people lacking the knowledge and skills to make informed decisions about their money. This lack of financial education has led to a low savings rate among individuals, as well as an attitude of "the
              <span>government will take care of me". These problems need to be addressed to ensure that individuals</span>
              can make sound financial decisions and build a secure future for themselves. To overcome these challenges, it is important to provide comprehensive financial education and resources that will help people understand the importance of saving and investing for their future. This could include taking online courses, reading personal finance books, or attending seminars.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Set Clear Financial Goals:
                <span> Before you can begin to develop money management skills, it's important to have specific financial goals in mind. This could include saving for a down payment </span>on a house or paying off credit card debt.
              </li>
              <li>Track Your Spending: A key part of understanding your finances is tracking your spending. Keep a ledger of all your expenses and compare them to your income. This <span>will</span> help you understand where your money is going and make adjustments if necessary.</li>
              <li>Create a Budget: Once you have an idea of where your money is going, create a budget that allows you to prioritize important expenses. This can help you manage your finances effectively and avoid unnecessary expenses.</li>
              <li>Pay Yourself First: One of the most effective ways to save money is to pay <span>yourself</span> first. This means allocating a portion of your income towards savings before paying bills or other expenses.</li>
              <li>Start Investing: Investing in assets such as global index funds can generate long-term returns and help grow your wealth over time.</li>
